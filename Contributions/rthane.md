## For the project, I was mainly working on the following:
- Full ownership & prominent contributions in the ideation, architecture and choosing the tech stack of the app.
- Created the first iteration of the app using vanilla JS which was later enhanced by using ReactJS and NodeJs.
- Researched on private passwordless login, worked on implementing the same using MetaMask
- Developed Database routes
- Researched and implemented the encryption schemes to preserve user privacy (XChaCha20-Poly1305 & AES-GCM)
- Project management using GitLab issues
- Created the app's end-to-end flow diagram
- Worked on the `architecture.md`, explained privacy features & elaborated on encryption `report.md`, added citations and reviewed them.
- Collaborated with @vshiri and @akapur on the app's implementation(frontend,backend,database,etc), documentation, report, etc
- Worked on explaining the features (both privacy & functional) in the presentation and the final report. Covered the encryption aspects and how it is preserving user privacy in depth.
