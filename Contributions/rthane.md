## For the project, I was mainly working on the following:
- In charge of the ideation, architecture and choosing the tech stack of the app.
- Created the vanilla JS app.
- Researched on private passwordless login, worked on implementing the same using MetaMask
- Developed Database routes
- Researched and implemented the encryption schemes to preserve user privacy (XChaCha20-Poly1305 & AES-GCM)
- Project management using GitLab issues
- Created the app's end-to-end flow diagram
- Worked on the `architecture.md`, some conteant of `report.md`, added citations and reviewed them.
