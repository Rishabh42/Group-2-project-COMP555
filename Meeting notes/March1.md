### General ideas:
note taking
photo sharing
to do list
zoom

### Light weight: KISS Note taking (Big fat smooch)
 - Web app - sync across devices at same time
 - Text and checklists

### Privacy:
 - Don't want our identity to be linked to our notes.
	(What about passwordless logins?)
 - Don't want our notes to be scanned.
	(Do not have the layer which allows notes to be in a position to be read.)
 - End to End encryption: Source and Destination.
 - Does not collect device or usage information.
 - Broadcast mode: IPFS storage
 

### Tech Stack:
- Progressive web app
- Backend: Python (so far)
- Frontend: React

### To Do:
- Choose techstack
- Security: Cryptography principles, IPFS (Can we use IPFS without a wallet?)
- Privacy by Design
- Architecture and Design
	- Scalability
	- Storage
	- How to share?
