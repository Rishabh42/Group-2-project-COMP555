we can switch the github account to gitlab account using the following commands:

git config --global user.name "akapur12"
git config --global user.email "akapur12@gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca"

(This is the global vars; better way would be to configure at project level but we will go ahead as is for now. Be sure to change the global vars back to original github though.)
