* ~~**Sunday 09 Apr 23:55: Final submission deadline via repo tagging.**~~



### Deliverables

* ~~Create a new GitLabs repo for your project and invite the instructor and TA as members.~~ 
* ~~Use the `README.md` as the landing page to provide an overview and orientation through your repo.~~
* ~~Include a `Requirements.md`, `Architecture.md`, `Report.md`, and `Workflow.md` files at the root of the repo.~~
* ~~Structure the rest of the repo consistently with the technology you are using.~~
* To submit your work, simply tag your repo with `v1.0` before the deadline. If you tag it as such and realize you need to make additional modifications _before the deadline_, increase the minor version. We will grade the highest `1.x` version tagged before the deadline.
* For each member, include _by the deadline_ in a file `contributions/userhandle.md` a _contribution statement_ that explains your role and responsibilities in the team and provides a summary of your main contributions, linked to relevant issues and commits. `userhandle` refers to you GitLabs user name without the initial `@`, e.g., `contributions/martin.md` for Martin Robillard. 

## Requirements Template

_Customize the structure of your requirements document to fit your needs and minimize clutter and useless boilerplate text. However, include at least the following elements, prominently labeled:_

* **System Purpose and Scope:** Describe the main function of the system and its functional boundaries. For example, is this a podcast listener? An information website? An image sharing tool? Clarify any potential ambiguity about the extent of the functionality it would cover. As appropriate, if it is not obvious, briefly point out the main privacy requirements. Consider this section to be a kind of self-contained introduction meant to orient the reader.

* **Sample Systems:** Briefly describe and refer to the home page of systems in the same class. Presumably these would be systems that are _not_ implemented following the principles of Privacy by Design. Envision this section as a kind of comparison between your future system and the existing "competition" (see [the Threema docs](https://threema.ch/en/messenger-comparison) for an example of what this can look like).

* **Functional Requirements:** List, using a structured format (e.g., enumerated lists organized by section) the main functional requirements your system will support. Include in this list any required system or user interface requirements.

* **Privacy Requirements:** List, using a structured format (e.g., enumerated lists organized by section) the main privacy requirements your system will support. 

* **Privacy by Design:** Explain how your system will realize the principles of privacy by design.
