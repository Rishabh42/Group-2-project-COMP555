Points considered:
- We will need a JWT for each user, if not anyone will be able to access anyone’s notes. How to handle saving user’s JWT on the system?
- Sign in using Metamask: [https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/one-click-login-flows-a-metamask-tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/one-click-login-flows-a-metamask-tutorial) - should we store users in DB with public address and nonce?
- Note saving on IPFS - where to store CIDs?
- Check feasibility of E2E for sharing the notes
- Convert frontend to Node.
