### plan for dev

step 1: make a note taking app working on local machine with encryption for storage of notes.

step 2: extend it to include private ipfs network over the set of trusted user devices.

step 3: include meta mask for user login.

step 4: bit of a stretch - include sandbox technique for sharing notes and giving access to third party plugins (or) determine a better way for sharing notes in a secure manner while maintaining the privacy aspects of the app.
